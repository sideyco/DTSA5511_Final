# DTSA5511_Final
Repository for DTSA 5511 Final Project. This project attempts to use deep learning techniques to classify music clips.  
## Introduction  
I developed the code in the notebook using Google Colab. I chose that environment to leverage their available GPU resources. If you plan on running the notebook yourself, I recommend connecting to a GPU runtime.  
The data for this project comes from processed mp3 files. Those files were generously curated by the authors here: https://github.com/mdeff/fma. The notebook uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify the processed mp3 files using CNN and RNN techniques.
